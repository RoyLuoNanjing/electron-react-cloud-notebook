# A cloud-based Markdown notebook program written in TypeScript using Electron-React-Boilerplate
## What is Electron? 
It is an interesting web technology embedding Chromium and Node.js to enable web developers to create desktop applications.

Electron apps run on three platforms across all supported architectures (Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux).

It surprised me to see that many software applications I use were developed using Electron, including 1Password, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Postman, and of course, VS Code!

## What I learnt in this repo
As a beginner, I didn't have high expectations for this project. However, I found it really interesting to learn about the concepts of how my program interacts with the operating system, even though I was just writing TypeScript within the React framework. 

It also served as an exercise to train and test how quickly I could absorb new knowledge and solve problems independently in software development.



## What can this program do? 
It's a markdown notebook where you can create, edit, delete, import, and export MD files. Additionally, it has the capability to sync with any cloud storage service such as AWS S3.

Most importantly, it functions like a web product, but you can also download and install this Electron program.
